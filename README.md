# easier-linux-personal

A project to make usage of the Linux Operating System easier tweaked to my personal preferences.

## Important Note!

Plz! don't use ./install.sh and install the complete project. Instead, if you like some script/file, just download and use that one script/file.

**OR**

Check if the project [easier-linux](https://github.com/realmazharhussain/easier-linux.git) exists. If it exists, you can use that. At the time of writing this, I haven't created that project yet. But I plan on doing so. So, if you are reading this in the future, that project may already exist. That project is supposed to be a generic/not-personalized version of this project that everyone can use.
